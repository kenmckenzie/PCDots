# i3wmDots
![Screenshot](screenshot/screenshot.png)

This repo is extremely out of date as I have not used my desktop for some time, Please rather look at Laptopdots repo for my current rice
It will be changed once I have access to my pc again

My personal dotfiles for i3wm and sundry apps. Used on Manjaro so your mileage may vary on other distro's. (Although any arch based distro SHOULD work)

I use user templates for Pywal extremely heavily. in other words. many of the config files are actually in the ~/.config/wal/Templates folder. they need to be copied to your
equivalent folder and then symlinked to their usual locations for them to work. this applies to all apps starred below on the list

# Applications Needed
-i3wm gapps (Obviously)

-ncmpcpp with mopidy and mopidy-spotify (visualizer works but is a hackjob)

-ranger

* -conky (radeontop is a dependency)

-Polybar

-Pywal(By far the most important, I love this app)

-wpgtk (Needed to theme gtk via pywal schemes) I dont personally use it anymore however

* -dunst (Create a symlink from the /.cache/Wal/dunstrc to the dunst config folder for theming to work

-nitrogen (for wallpapers, you can also use feh but i3 config will need to be edited)

-urxvt

- zsh + oh-my-zsh

-Yay (not needed but manually building everythings a pain )

-lx-appearance (Not strictly needed but makes config abit easier)

* -Rofi

-Playerctl

-vim, I would highly recomend taking a look at the following vim config,https://github.com/amix/vimrc its damn good and easy to install even for novice's (or the lazy)


Note that I predominantly use Hack Nerd Font so please make sure that is installed or
adjust accordingly (The fonts I use are included)
