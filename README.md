My personal dotfiles for dwm , i3  and sundry apps. Used on Arch so your mileage may vary on other distro's. (Although any arch based distro SHOULD work)

I use user templates for Pywal extremely heavily. in other words. many of the config files are actually in the ~/.config/wal/Templates folder, they need to be symlinked to their usual locations for them to work. 

Unfortunately there is alot of manual work required to get the config as displayed, am planning to write a script to do the heavy lifting in future.

# Recomended Apps
- dwm or i3wm gapps (Please make use of my dwm repo if you'd like my rice)

- dmenu (I have a custom build if needed)

- spotifytui

- ranger

- conky (Symlink needed)

- Polybar

- Pywal(By far the most important, I love this app)

- wpgtk (Needed to theme gtk via pywal schemes)

 - dunst (Create a symlink from the /.cache/Wal/dunstrc to the dunst config folder for theming to work) 

- xwallpaper 

- st or urxvt (config is set assuming you use st though, build is in repos)

- zsh + oh-my-zsh

-  yay (not needed but manually building everythings a pain )

- lx-appearance (Not strictly needed but makes config abit easier)

* - rofi 

- vim, I would highly recomend taking a look at the following vim config,https://github.com/amix/vimrc its damn good and easy to install even for novice's (or the lazy)


Note that I predominantly use Hack Nerd Font so please make sure that is installed or
adjust accordingly (The fonts I use are included)
